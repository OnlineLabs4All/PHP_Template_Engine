Template Experiment Engine in PHP - Batched Labs
================================================

This template experiment engine developed in PHP dequeues experiments submitted to an specific lab server and returns an experiment result string. The results shall be generated by your experiment logic and can be encoded using any schema.

## Installation

Installation using Composer (https://getcomposer.org/) is supported.

Dowload or clone the source code with:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/OnlineLabs4All/PHP_Template_Engine.git
```
cd to the folder where the engine was downloaded and run
```
$ composer install
```
Composer will download and install the dependencies. In our case, the only dependency is a library (HTTPful - http://phphttpclient.com/).

Rename config.php.dist to config.php:
```
$ cp config.php.dist config.php
```
Replace USERNAME, PASSWORD and APIKEY with the engine's real credentials obtained from the Experiment Dispatcher.

## Run the engine
```
$ php engine.php
```
